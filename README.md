# AuthenticationServer
This is a authentication server based on local storage (local storage for small scale authentication)
#Why Not MongoDB
we can connect this project by mongoose connnect instead of a local storage for much reliability but however mongoose is something im pursuing and almost done, might use mongo for my next prject!
